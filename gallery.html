                        <p id="first-p">I am a software developer from Nashville, TN and a recent Computer Science graduate from the Univeristy of Alabama in Huntsville.</p>
                        <p>Previously, I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Emerson in Knoxville, TN. As a Backend Developer, my primary responsibility was developing a REST API and contributing to the data layer of a web application that interfaced with a hierarchy of complex data structures.</p>
                        <p>One of my greatest passions is learning. Regardless of its pertinence to programming and software design, I believe one should strive to learn something new everyday. When I am not writing code, I enjoy listening to music and discussing music with my friends.</p>
                        <p>I am currently seeking full-time software engineering roles in the Nashville, TN area.</p>
